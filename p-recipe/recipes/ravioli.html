    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A delicious ravioli recipe</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Flour – Use fine ground durum wheat semolina flour. If you cannot find
        this, use 00 or bread flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eggs – You will need large room temperature or cold eggs for the filling
        and the dough.
      </li>
      <li>Oil – Use a good extra virgin olive oil.</li>
      <li>Salt – I always use sea salt in my cooking and baking.</li>
      <li>
        Water – You will need a few tablespoons of cold water for the ravioli
        dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meat – Use 80/20 ground sirloin. You can also use a leaner ratio like
        90/10.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cheese – You will need whole milk ricotta cheese and pecorino Romano
        cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seasonings – A combination of dried oregano and garlic granules is used
        for the filling. In addition, you will use salt and pepper to help
        season the filling.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the dough: Make and knead the dough, then form it into a ball.
        Tightly wrap the ball and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the filling: Mix the filling ingredients together and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the sauce: Cook the garlic and pesto in oil, stir in the heavy
        cream, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, then whisk in the
        Parmesan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the ravioli: Roll out the dough into sheets. Drop cheese
        filling onto the dough about an inch apart. Cover with the top sheet of
        pasta and make a seal around each portion of filling. Cut out individual
        ravioli, then seal the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook and bake the ravioli: Boil the ravioli in salted water until the
        dumplings rise to the top and the filling is hot. Drain well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the ravioli: Divide the ravioli between bowls, top with the warmed
        marinara sauce, then finish with the sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
